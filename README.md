**Fornax** is an extensive raw image processing library.
Its goal is to provide a one-stop solution for raw image processing with both simple high-level APIs and low-level control, while also enabling users to extend or plug in their own raw image processing algorithms.

Fornax uses built-in or custom decoders and post-processors to produce `ImageBuffer`s (from the [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image) crate) that can be further transformed into other data types for analysis or display.

## Key Features

- üñº **Flexible decoding pipeline** ‚Äî Choose built-in or custom decoders.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Extensible post-processing** ‚Äî Plug in your own algorithms.
- ü¶Ä **Rust + Python support** ‚Äî Native performance with Python accessibility.
- üîí **Safe abstractions** ‚Äî Rust bindings to LibRaw with memory safety in mind.
